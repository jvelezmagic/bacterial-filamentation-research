# Hypothesis and objectives {#sec-hypothesis .unnumbered}

## Hypothesis

Bacterial exposure to a stressful environment, such as openness to antibiotics, can trigger filamentous-like growth in the bacteria, which can increase their probabilities of survival compared to those bacteria that are unable to the filament.

## General objective

To characterize bacterial survival due to filamentation upon antibiotics exposure, mathematically and experimentally in strains with chromosomal resistance genes or a non-conjugative multicopy plasmid.

## Particular objectives

-   Obtain time series with the state of each bacteria before exposure to antibiotics (*i.e*., normal, stressed, or dead).

-   Quantify cell growth and division rates and correlate them with cell status.

-   Mathematical modeling of bacterial filamentation based on cell length and internal concentration of antibiotics over time.

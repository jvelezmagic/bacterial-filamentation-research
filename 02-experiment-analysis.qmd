## Introduction

The previous chapter (see @sec-image-processing) detailed the steps
necessary to extract data from a set of microfluidic images through
image analysis techniques and fluorescence microscopy. Each step was
instrumental in creating a dataset that was easy to explore and ask
questions. With the help of computational biology, systems biology, and
data analysis techniques, we could process these files to help us in the
search to find the role of filamentation in cell survival.

Both the ideas and concepts of computational biology and systems biology
contributed to the development of this analysis. In principle,
computational biology originated after the origin of computer science
with the British mathematician and logistician Alan Turing (regularly
known as the father of computing) [@turing1950]. Over time, systems
biology emerged as an area that synergistically combines models and
experimental data to understand biological processes [@bruggeman]. Thus,
giving a step towards creating models that, in general, are
phenomenological but that sometimes serve to discover new ideas about
the process under study. Ideas and aspects of the study of biological
sciences that otherwise could be unthinkable without the computer's
power.

Here, we divide the experimental analysis into two main parts: 1) at the
cell level or measurements at specific points in time and 2) at the
population level and time series. The first level allowed us to identify
the individual contribution of each variable understudy to determine
cell survival. The second level allowed us to understand how the
population behaves according to the passage of time in the face of
exposure to a harmful agent (in this case, beta-lactam antibiotics).
Together, both visions of the same study phenomenon allowed us to
extract the main ideas for postulating a mathematical model that seeks
to show how filamentation is a factor for cell survival in stressful
environments (see @sec-model-analysis).

## General preprocessing of data {#sec-experiment-general-preprocessing}

The raw data processing consisted mainly of creating two levels of
observation for the cells of both chromosomal strains and multicopy
plasmids. The first level is at a cell granularity, that is, point
properties. The second level consists of the cells over time, thus
observing properties at the population level. We did this because it
would allow us to understand what factors are affecting filamentation
and why.

We normalized the fluorescence values of DsRed and GFP for both
experiments based on the values observed before exposure to antibiotics.
It allowed us to have a basis to work with and compare expressions
between cells. In the case of DsRed environment drug concentration, we
also applied a logarithmic transformation to observe subtle changes in
fluorescence intensity that would allow us to detect cell dead.

Ultimately, we decided to classify cells into four fundamental groups
based on whether the cell filamented and survived (see
@fig-cell-distribution-across-experiments). We define a *filamented
cell* as a cell with more than two standard deviations from the mean
concerning the lengths observed before introducing antibiotics into the
system. On the other hand, although there are multiple ways to define
death from single-cell observations [@trevors2012; @kroemer2008], we
considered a *cell dead or missing* when we stopped having information
about it, either because of fluorescence in the red channel was above a
given threshold (resulting from an increase in cell membrane
permeability and the introduction of fluorescent dye into the cell) or
because it left the field of observation. Therefore, a *surviving cell*
is defined as a cell observed before and after exposure to the
antibiotic and does not surpass the DsRed threshold.

## Results

### Cell length and the amount of GFP are crucial in determining cell survival {#sec-length-gfp-crucial}

We evaluated the DsRed, GFP, and length values for each cell at
different time points: initial, filamentation, and end. This
preprocessing allowed us to observe and quantify each cell at critical
times in the experiment and eliminate noise or signals outside the scope
of this investigation.

We define the *initial time* as the first time we observed the cell in
the experiment. *Filamentation time* equals when a cell reaches the
filamentation threshold (see @fig-length-temporal-distribution) for the
first time. We defined the *end time* as the time of the last
observation of the cell. We decided to bound the end time for surviving
cells to one frame (10 min) after the end of antibiotic exposure so that
the observed signal would reflect the final stress responses.

When we compared the distributions of DsRed, GFP, and length for both
experiments, we observed its changes in its role for cell survival. In
@fig-dsred-temporal-distribution, we show that indistinctly and, as
expected, surviving cells managed to eliminate the antibiotic by the end
time. In contrast, dead cells presented higher levels of antibiotics
(measured by proxy through the mean DsRed intensity of the cell).

On the other hand, GFP observations in @fig-gfp-temporal-distribution
showed us two essential things for cell classification: 1) The
chromosomal strain did not exhibit noticeable changes in GFP levels, and
2) filamented cells were those that had low fluorescent intensities (low
plasmid copy-number) at the beginning of the experiment. For the final
observation times, GFP measurements indicated that among the cells that
did not filament, the ones that survived exhibited a reduced GFP
expression concerning cells killed by the antibiotic. Meanwhile, for the
filamented cells, whether surviving or dead, their GFP measurements
indicated no difference at the beginning or the end of the experiment,
suggesting the presence of other determinants of cell survival.

#|   fluorescent intensity values. As expected,
#|   in the plasmid strain, filamented cells had a lower initial GFP.
#|   At the time of filamentation, there appear to be differences in
#|   fluorescence between surviving and dead cells. However, in the end time,

Cell length was one of the factors that GFP expression levels could not
explain for cell survival. In @fig-length-temporal-distribution, we show
that the conclusions regarding filamentation were applicable for both
chromosomal or plasmid strains. For the initial times, filamented and
survived cells were shorter in length than those that died but longer
than not filamented cells of both classes, while non-filamented cells
did not differ from each other. We observed no length differences
between cells at filamentation time. Thus, survival could depend on
other factors, such as growth rate. At the final time, the results were
well-defined. Surviving cells had a greater length relative to their
non-surviving pair (*i.e.*, dead filamented and non-filamented cells).
However, for filamented cells, surviving cells represent a distribution
of higher final length values in general but not as extensive as their
dead counterpart. Which we could explain as a length limit to which
cells can grow without dying. Nevertheless, we had no information to
evaluate such a hypothesis.

#|   To evaluate the incident effect of length on cells by class,

#|   The observations for both strains, chromosomal or plasmid, are the same.
#|   In the beginning, the surviving filamented cells already have a difference
#|   in length concerning the rest of the classes. At the time of
#|   filamentation, there is no difference to help determine whether the
#|   cell will survive or not. Finally, in the final time, it seems that
#|   the surviving filamented cells have a greater length than the rest
#|   of the groups. However, this length is moderate compared to the excess
#|   length shown by non-surviving filamented cells. On the other hand,
#|   we highlighted the growth of the surviving non-filamented cells.
#|   Therefore, although they did not reach a length for us to classify as

Once we observed the effects of GFP expression levels and lengths in
determining whether a cell lives or dies, we projected the cells onto
the plane and painted them with their class status (See
@fig-cell-distribution-across-experiments) to determine whether these
two variables contained the necessary information to cluster the data
correctly. In @fig-just-initial-values, we show the initial GFP and
length values projection. While, with some work, we could contextually
place the results in Figures @fig-gfp-temporal-distribution and
@fig-length-temporal-distribution, the initial values did not appear to
determine the classes. Therefore, we explored the final versus initial
values differences in @fig-metric-differences. With this new
representation of the cells in the plane, we contextualized the
statistical results presented in Figures @fig-gfp-temporal-distribution
and @fig-length-temporal-distribution. Besides, it showed us that
differences in length (*i.e.*, filamentation) and reductions in GFP
expression are essential in determining cell survival. Though, the
clustering of cells by state is not completely separated, which means
that other variables are affection the experimental results in cell
survival.

#|   the example of the length changes throughout the experiment caused

### Number of divisions and cell age do not appear to play a clear role in determining cell survival

In @sec-length-gfp-crucial, we explored how GFP variability and cell
length influence cell survival. However, @fig-just-initial-values and
@fig-metric-differences showed us the possibility of other factors
relevant to the phenomenon under study. As some papers in the literature
suggest, some of these other factors may be cell division and
chronological age (*i.e.*, how much time has passed since the last cell
division at the time of exposure to a toxic agent) [@moger-reischer2019;
@roostalu2008; @heinrich2015]. Therefore, we chose to observe these two
metrics in experiments at a purely qualitative level, i.e., without the
inclusion of, e.g., metrics of membrane or cell cycle properties
[@Joseleau-Petit1999].

Although we expected to see a small contribution, either by the number
of divisions or cell age, in @fig-number-divisions and
@fig-time-since-last-division, we could not observe a precise effect of
these variables on cell survival. Patterns that, although they could
have an explanation or biological significance, we decided to omit as
relevant in the characterization of our cells, since the signal was not
clear. However, we derived from this analysis a slightly simpler
variable that tells us whether a cell underwent a cell division event or
not. So it gives us a more generalized picture of the contribution of
division to cell survival (see @fig-plasmid-pca-variable-contribution).

### Time to reach filamentation matters in determining cell survival

In @fig-dsred-temporal-distribution, @fig-gfp-temporal-distribution, and
@fig-length-temporal-distribution, we showed how, at the time of
filamentation, DsRed and GFP levels appeared indifferent to the cells.
Therefore, we hypothesized that a possible variable that could determine
cell survival could be its time to activate its anti-stress response
system that causes filamentation. Furthermore, we also guided our
hypothesis by previous reports showing us how the gene expression level
can induce filamentation with tight temporal coordination \[x\].

While, for our analyses, we did not measure the concentration of
antibiotic that triggers filamentation per se, we indirectly quantified
its effect by using the time it took for a cell to reach a length at
which it is already considered a filamentating cell. Furthermore, to
recognize that the observed effect was a product of the experiment, we
decided to keep only filamented cells just once antibiotic exposure
began.

@fig-time-to-filamentation-filtered shows how filamentation times are
narrower for chromosomal cells than for plasmid-bearing cells. Then, we
hypothesize that the effect could come from the heterogeneity in the
plasmid copy number in the population. Also, interestingly, we observed
that, for both experiments, cells that survived had longer filamentation
times than the cells that died. These differences in response times
suggest the following: 1) if the cell grows too fast, it will reach a
limit and start to accumulate antibiotics constantly, and 2) if the cell
grows too fast, it is likely that the cost of maintaining an ample
length for prolonged periods of exposure will become counterproductive.

```{r}

#|  To quantify the effect of filamented to survive, we filtered those
#|  cells that filamented during the experiment. In this way, we
#|  normalize the start times for the calculation of the filamentation
#|  time. For both strains, the filamentation time had a more significant
#|  delay in the surviving cells.

In Figure @fig-initial-values-with-time, we decided to project the
results of Figure @fig-time-to-filamentation-filtered in a space similar
to the one described in Figure @fig-just-initial-values). Thus, we
separated our data into cells that survived and cells that did not, and
painted them when it took them to reach their filamented state. We
realized that, indeed, by adding this temporal component to the initial
variables of length and GFP, we could separate surviving cells from dead
cells to a greater degree. However, it may still not be enough, and
there are still many other variables that play a crucial role in
understanding the ecology of stress and how some cells will be survivors
or not.

### Increasing the complexity of the system and analyzing it in an unsupervised way allows a correct classification of cell states {#sec-unsupervised-classification}

In the experiments, we observed the importance of GFP filamentation and
variability for cell survival. Similarly, we realized that other
variables must be affecting the final results. Filamentation and GFP
variability alone did not fully recapitulate the expected behavior of
the data. That is, the target variables did not capture the
heterogeneity of the system.

The inability to reproduce cell classification led us to question two
things: 1) the possibility that our sorting was wrong beforehand and 2)
we did not have enough variables to capture the study phenomenon. We
decided to take the unsupervised learning way to answer these subjects
because it allows us to project our data without a *priori* knowledge
\[\@\].

We opted for the path of dimensionality reduction techniques where each
variable or feature is equivalent to one dimension. The essence of
dimensionality reduction is that it is not feasible to analyze each
dimension with many dimensions. Furthermore, dimensionality reduction
helps us counteract several problems such as reducing the complexity of
a model, reducing the possibility of overfitting a model, removing all
correlated variables, and, of course, visualizing our data in a two- or
three-dimensional space for better appreciation \[\@\]. Improved
visualization and identification of essential variables are the main
reasons to guide and complement our research with this technique.

#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA) emphasizes the importance of cell length and its GFP in cell survival

```{r experiment-03-split-datasets}
#| results: hide
experiment_datasets <- cells_df %>% 
  select(experiment_id, cell_status, divided, contains("first"), contains("last"), -contains("time")) %>% 
  mutate(divided = as.numeric(divided)) %>% 
  select(where(~!any(is.na(.)))) %>% 
  glimpse() %>% 
  
  group_by(experiment_id) %>% 
  {
    grouped_data <- .
    group_split(grouped_data) %>% 
      set_names(nm = group_keys(grouped_data) %>% pull())
  } %>% 
  map(select, -experiment_id) %>% 
  identity()

chromosome_df <- experiment_datasets$Chromosome
plasmid_df <- experiment_datasets$Plasmid
```

The first dimensionality reduction technique we decided to use was
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [@pearson1901; @hotelling1936].
Scientist mainly uses PCA to create predictive models or in Exploratory
Data Analysis (EDA). In our case, we only use it as an EDA.

For chromosomal and plasmid strain, in
@fig-chromosome-pca-new-coordinates and
@fig-plasmid-pca-new-coordinates, we show the projection of the first
two principal components (PCs), respectively.
@fig-chromosome-pca-new-coordinates separates the manually annotated
classes, surviving cells separated from non-surviving cells. However,
for @fig-plasmid-pca-new-coordinates, the class separation was a bit
rougher but allowed us to separate the surviving filament cells from the
dead ones.

For their part, in @fig-chromosome-pca-variable-contribution and
@fig-plasmid-pca-variable-contribution, we show the total contribution
of each variable per PC for the chromosomal and plasmid strain,
respectively. Finding that, indeed, filamentation plays a crucial role
in determining cell survival. For example, for PC2, we appreciated how
the variable end DsRed directed the dots to the positive side, while the
variable end and start length directed the dots to the opposing side.
Therefore, we can support that filamentation has a role in moving cells
away from having higher amounts of DsRed.

#|   components 1 and 2 (X-axis and Y-axis, respectively) are the final

#### Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) correctly represents the local structure of cell states

Staying with only a one-dimensionality reduction technique was not an
option, so we used the UMAP technique [@mcinnes2018umap]. We mainly
decided to use UMAP for clustering purposes and see if the annotated
clusters corresponded to the manually annotated ones. UMAP has certain
advantages for these purposes, e.g., it preserves the global structure
across the whole space, so the distances between clusters matter.

In @fig-chromosome-umap-new-coordinates and
@fig-plasmid-umap-new-coordinates, we show how, using the same variables
used in the "PCA" section, UMAP was able to cluster the four proposed
classes correctly. Interestingly, in
@fig-chromosome-umap-new-coordinates, UMAP formed three general groups
and four for @fig-plasmid-umap-new-coordinates. However, in general,
UMAP clustered the surviving cells from those that did not survived. On
investigating why this separation occurred, we found that the large
groups coalesced into one another if we eliminated the division
variable. So, in a way, the division also has a role in determining
survival, but it is not essential or at least not over-represented in
our data.

From the full tracking dataset, we evaluated how the different cell
states behaved over time---for example, understanding how the cells
absorbed antibiotics or how they elongated in time. In contrast to the
dataset generated in the @sec-length-gfp-crucial, we did not truncate
the results 10 minutes after the antibiotic exposure. In this way, we
were able to observe cell behavior before and after the presence of the
toxic agent.

In @fig-status-with-dead, we observed a small fraction of cells that
were already filamentous without exposure to the toxic agent in both
cell strains. However, after the onset of antibiotic exposure at minute
60, we observed increases in the proportion of filamented cells. It is
interesting to note how filamented cells grew after antibiotic exposure
for the chromosomal strain. We speculate that this post-antibiotic
growth exists because, once the SOS system that triggers filamentation
is activated, the system continues to grow until it reaches a limit
regardless of whether the damaging agent is still present or not
[@justiceMorphologicalPlasticityBacterial2008; @mückl2018]. Moreover, we
observed how the cells start to divide again after some time because the
proportion of non-filament cells starts to grow while the filament cells
start to divide. We observed the same effects for the plasmid strain.
However, by experimental design, the number of filament cells expected
was much lower.

In @fig-metrics-over-time, we showed how once antibiotics exposure
began, those cells that died had a much faster increase in DsRed than
those that did manage to live, regardless of whether they filamented or
not. On the other hand, surviving cells managed to maintain their DsRed
levels relatively stable. We noted that length was critical for the
surviving cells for the chromosomal strain by turning to the GFP and
length variables for a temporal explanation. Even cells categorized as
non-filamented reached the filamentation threshold minutes after
antibiotic exposure. However, the distinction of live or dead filamented
cells was not as evident as expected. As for cells with plasmids, the
effect on GFP for surviving cells was maintained for filamented cells
and decreased for non-filamented cells. For the filament cells that
died, we showed that they had, on average, a much longer initial length
than the surviving cells, so we also consider it as a necessary factor
in understanding which variables affect cell survival.

#|   is observed for the population that did not survive. For the length metric,

#|   continued to grow past the filamentation threshold once the exposure to

### Heterogeneity in plasmid copy-number allows various forms of survival in addition to filamentation

We are confident that filamentation has a fundamental role in
determining cell survival, with what we have shown so far. However, for
plasmid cells, we have a component that is of our complete interest;
heterogeneity. Each cell can possess a different plasmid copy-number;
thus, each could show a different behavior under stress
[@sanmillan2016]. For instance, heterogeneity can produce resistant
cells that do not suffer damage, susceptible cells, and cells that form
filaments to mitigate environmental stress.

To study the effect of variability in plasmid copy number in the
survival probability of the population, we decided to group cells by the
proportion of initial GFP with respect to the population maximum. We
defined 100% of the population as the number of total cells at the onset
of antibiotic exposure. @fig-proportion-living-cells-gfp-by-row shows
how the cells with the highest amount of GFP remained unchanged once
antibiotic exposure began, while the rest of the cells started to
decrease their percentage of surviving cells. However, the decrease was
not linear. On the contrary, we observed a bi-modal distribution on the
reduction of live cells. An average GFP point provided higher survival
than a point below or above the average (except for cells very close to
the population maximum).

```{r}
#| label: fig-proportion-living-cells-gfp-by-row
#| fig-scap: Population survivals binned by initial GFP over time.
#| fig-cap: >
#|   **Population survivals binned by initial GFP over time.**
#|   We categorized the cells' GFP into ranges of proportions 0.05 concerning
#|   the maximum amount of GFP in the population. 100% cells per bin of GFP
#|   was taken as the number of cells one frame before the start of exposure
#|   to the antibiotic (minute 50). Therefore, dark to light colors represent a
#|   generation of new cells, and light to dark colors the death of cells.
#|   The black vertical bars represent the start and end of the antibiotic
#|   exposure. Bars size and color on the right represent the percentage of
#|   the living cells 10 minutes after the end of the experiment. As shown in
#|   @fig-gfp-survival-probability, we showed that the surviving cells appear
#|   to follow something similar to a bimodal distribution. More cells survive
#|   with a moderate amount of GFP or with an amount close to the maximum of
#|   the population.

Therefore, what we observed was a bimodal distribution for GFP-dependent
cell survival. In order to show this effect more clearly, in
@fig-gfp-survival-probability, we plotted the survival probability for
each GFP bin without normalizing for the population maximum. This new
plot allowed us to observe how the bimodal survival distribution occurs
for cells that did not grow as filaments, whereas cells that filament
increase their survival probability gradually as they have more initial
GFP (see also @fig-gfp-temporal-distribution).-distribution).

#|   for the filamented cells (red dots), a continuous increase in survival is

As in @fig-gfp-survival-probability, in
@fig-length-survival-probability, we show the survival probability given
an initial length. We observe that survival is higher for cells that did
not grow as filament if the initial length was less than the average. In
contrast, for filamented cells, the probability of survival increased as
cells length was longer at the beginning of the experiment (see also
@fig-length-temporal-distribution). However, it is noteworthy that the
probability of survival had a limit in which a higher initial length
meant a lower probability of survival (see red dotted lines in
@fig-length-survival-probability).

## Discussion

Here, we evaluated different variables that could determine cell
survival upon exposure to toxic agents by studying two experimental
populations of *E. coli*, one strain with a resistance gene on the
chromosome and the other on multicopy plasmids. We identified two
variables that are predominantly responsible for cell survival: cell
length and GFP amount related to the cell's inherent resistance to the
toxic agent and heterogeneity in response times.

On the other hand, as other studies have already mentioned
[@heinrich2015; @wang2009], we examined cell activity and youth in a
minimalistic way. While the distribution of the number of divisions
exemplifies a broader and more uniform range for the surviving cells,
the cells that died showed a tendency to a lower number of divisions.
However, for the study of cellular youth at the time of exposure to the
toxic agent, the results did not show a clear pattern of behavior for
cell fate determination. Therefore, it would be interesting to study
cellular youth at a higher level of complexity in future studies to
understand its contribution to cell survival.

Interestingly, when we used temporal measurements of cell length, GFP,
DsRed, and if a cell divided, we could recapitulate, for the most part,
the fates of cellular states (see @sec-length-gfp-crucial and
@sec-unsupervised-classification). Thus, increasing the system's
complexity led to better clustering cell states, but not how these
factors interact biologically in determining cell survival. Therefore,
we decided to postulate a mathematical model that helps us understand
the critical components in cell survival.
